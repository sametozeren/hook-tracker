# API Contract (v1)

Base path `/v1`. All responses are JSON. Errors follow RFC 9457 (`application/problem+json`).

Two authentication schemes coexist:

- **API key** — ingestion only (`POST /v1/publish`). Header `Authorization: Bearer ht_<key>`.
- **User JWT** — every dashboard route. Header `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.

## Error Shape

```json
{
  "type": "urn:hook-tracker:error:rate-limited",
  "title": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "status": 429,
  "detail": "600 requests per minute allowed for this API key",
  "instance": "/v1/publish",
  "requestId": "01J8QW..."
}
```

Validation failures add an `errors` array of `{ path, message }` produced from the zod issue list.

## Ingestion

### `POST /v1/publish`

Auth: API key. Headers: optional `Idempotency-Key`.

```json
{
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "payload": { "orderId": 1234, "total": 99.9 },
  "endpointIds": ["ep_..."]
}
```

`eventType` matches `^[a-z0-9]+([._-][a-z0-9]+)*$`, at most 64 characters.

`endpointIds` is optional. When omitted the event fans out to every `ACTIVE` endpoint of the project whose `eventTypes` matches `eventType` — exact entry, trailing-wildcard entry (`order.*`), or an empty array meaning all events. When supplied, the listed endpoints are used regardless of their subscriptions; duplicates are collapsed, and an id outside the caller's project is rejected with `422` without disclosing whether it exists.

`202 Accepted`:

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_...",
  "deliveries": [{ "id": "dlv_...", "endpointId": "ep_...", "status": "PENDING" }]
}
```

Failure modes: `400` invalid body, `401` missing or revoked key, `413` payload above `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `409` idempotency key in flight, `422` no matching endpoint, `429` rate limited.

`413` is answered by the body parser, before authentication: a body that cannot be read cannot be authenticated either, and reading it to the end only to reject it is the thing the limit exists to prevent.

Every response carries `X-Request-Id`. A caller may set the header itself — it is echoed when it matches `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}` — which is what lets a request be followed from the caller's logs into hook-tracker's.

## Authentication

| Method | Path                | Purpose                                          |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/register` | first user creates a project and becomes `OWNER` |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/login`    | returns access token, sets refresh cookie        |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/refresh`  | rotates the refresh token                        |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/logout`   | revokes the refresh token                        |
| GET    | `/v1/auth/me`       | current user with memberships                    |

Auth routes are rate limited per IP (20 attempts per minute), separately from the per-key ingestion limit, because the caller of a login attempt has no key yet.

`register` and `login` return `{ user, project?, accessToken }` and set the refresh cookie. `refresh` returns a new `accessToken` and replaces the cookie; the token it was called with is revoked in the same step, so calling it twice with the same cookie is a `401`.

## Projects & Members

| Method | Path                                      | Purpose                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/v1/projects`                            | projects the user belongs to   |
| POST   | `/v1/projects`                            | create, caller becomes `OWNER` |
| PATCH  | `/v1/projects/:projectId`                 | rename, set the alert address  |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/members`         | list                           |
| POST   | `/v1/projects/:projectId/members`         | add by email, `OWNER` only     |
| DELETE | `/v1/projects/:projectId/members/:userId` | remove, `OWNER` only           |

`PATCH /v1/projects/:projectId` is a partial update, `OWNER` only. It accepts `name`, `alertWebhookUrl` or both, and at least one of them:

```json
{ "alertWebhookUrl": "https://alerts.example.com/hook-tracker" }
```

`null` clears the address and turns alerting off for the project. The URL runs through the same SSRF guard endpoint URLs do, so a blocked target is refused with `422` and `The URL is not an allowed alert target: ...` rather than accepted and dropped at send time. Every project object — here, in `GET /v1/projects` and in `GET /v1/auth/me` — carries `alertWebhookUrl`.

Alerts are described in `docs/architecture.md` §10: unsigned, never retried, at most one per `ALERT_SUPPRESSION_MINUTES` for the same reason and scope.

## API Keys

| Method | Path                                      | Purpose                             |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/api-keys`        | list, prefix only, never the secret |
| POST   | `/v1/projects/:projectId/api-keys`        | create, returns plaintext **once**  |
| DELETE | `/v1/projects/:projectId/api-keys/:keyId` | revoke                              |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                                      | Purpose                                                    |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/endpoints`       | list                                                       |
| POST   | `/v1/projects/:projectId/endpoints`       | create; the signing secret is returned once                |
| PATCH  | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId`               | url, description, `eventTypes`, `rateLimitPerMinute`       |
| POST   | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId/rotate-secret` | starts the rotation grace window                           |
| POST   | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId/enable`        | clears `consecutiveFailures`                               |
| POST   | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId/disable`       | manual disable                                             |
| DELETE | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId`               | delete                                                     |
| POST   | `/v1/endpoints/:endpointId/test`          | sends a synthetic `ping` event through the normal pipeline |

Creating or updating a URL runs the SSRF guard synchronously and rejects a blocked target with `422` rather than accepting it and failing later at delivery time.

## Events

| Method | Path                             | Purpose                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/events` | events this project received; cursor pagination and search |
| GET    | `/v1/events/:eventId`            | the event, its payload and the deliveries it produced      |

Filters: `eventType`, `from`, `to`, `cursor`, `limit`, and the pair `payloadPath` / `payloadValue`. Pagination is keyset over `receivedAt` and `id`, the same shape the delivery list uses, and a page is `{ events, nextCursor }`.

A list row carries `deliveryCount` and `byStatus`, the fan-out of that event counted by delivery status. The payload is list-only in the sense that it is _not_ there: it is returned by the single-event route, because a page of fifty payloads is a page nobody asked for.

**Search** is exact containment at a path, not substring matching: `?payloadPath=customer.id&payloadValue=cus_9` finds events whose payload contains `{"customer":{"id":"cus_9"}}`. Both are required together; `payloadPath` alone is a `400`. JSON keeps `1234` and `"1234"` apart, so a numeric-looking value is matched as both. Containment is what the GIN index on `payload` answers; substring search across the whole document would need a trigram index whose write cost would land on the ingestion path, and it is deliberately out of scope.

## Deliveries

| Method | Path                                             | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/deliveries`             | cursor pagination; filters `status`, `endpointId`, `eventType`, `from`, `to`   |
| GET    | `/v1/deliveries/:deliveryId`                     | delivery with its full attempt list                                            |
| POST   | `/v1/deliveries/:deliveryId/replay`              | new Delivery row, `replayedFromId` set; `409` if the original has not finished |
| POST   | `/v1/projects/:projectId/deliveries/bulk-replay` | replays a filtered set, capped at `BULK_REPLAY_LIMIT`                          |
| GET    | `/v1/projects/:projectId/stats`                  | counts by status and a delivery-latency summary for the dashboard header       |

Listing uses keyset pagination (`?cursor=&limit=`) rather than `OFFSET`, because the delivery table grows without bound. A page is `{ deliveries, nextCursor }`, and `nextCursor` is `null` on the last page. The cursor encodes `createdAt` and `id` together: `createdAt` alone is not unique, and a boundary that fell inside a group of same-millisecond rows would repeat or skip them.

A list row carries the delivery fields plus `eventType`, `receivedAt`, `lastResponseStatus` and `lastDurationMs` — the `responseStatus` and `durationMs` of the delivery's newest attempt, both `null` when no attempt has been recorded yet, and `lastResponseStatus` `null` when the attempt errored before a response. Those four are list-only: the single-delivery response carries the full `attempts` array instead.

Replay is offered for a delivery that has stopped — `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED_PERMANENTLY`, `SKIPPED` — and for one still walking the ladder in `RETRYING`, so an operator who fixed the endpoint does not have to wait out the remaining attempts. A delivery that is `PENDING` or `IN_FLIGHT` is refused with `409`: it is still on its way out, and replaying it would only queue a duplicate. Bulk replay skips those rows instead of refusing the batch, and says so in its `replayed` count.

`bulk-replay` answers `{ matched, replayed, cappedAt, deliveries }`. `matched` counts the rows the filter selected, `replayed` counts those that were in a state worth replaying, and `cappedAt` reports the limit that was applied — a silent truncation would read as "everything was replayed".

`stats` answers `{ byStatus, total, latency: { attempts, averageMs, slowestMs } }`.

Deleting an endpoint that already has delivery history is refused with `409`; disabling it is the operation that keeps the audit trail intact.

## Operational

| Method | Path            | Auth                                                                            | Purpose                                        |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`       | none                                                                            | liveness                                       |
| GET    | `/ready`        | none                                                                            | dependency readiness                           |
| GET    | `/metrics`      | none — rides the published API port; block at the reverse proxy in a deployment | Prometheus exposition                          |
| GET    | `/docs`         | none                                                                            | Swagger UI over the generated OpenAPI document |
| GET    | `/openapi.json` | none                                                                            | the document itself                            |

The OpenAPI document is generated from the same zod schemas the routes validate with, so the spec cannot drift from the implementation. Response shapes, which no zod schema validates at runtime, are declared next to the request schemas in `src/api/schemas/responses.js` and built from the same shared enums the services write. Swagger UI is served from the installed `swagger-ui-dist` package rather than a CDN, so `/docs` opens on a closed network.
