# hook-tracker — System Architecture & Technical Specification

## 1. Purpose & Problem Statement
hook-tracker is a distributed intermediary layer (webhook gateway) designed to reliably deliver outbound HTTP notifications (webhooks) from client backend services to third-party endpoints, ensuring zero data loss even if recipient servers are down, slow, or unstable.

It ships as a self-contained repository: `docker compose up` must bring up the full stack (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, API, worker, dashboard, demo receiver) with no manual step beyond copying `.env.example`.

```

A single image is built from `backend/`; the `api`, `worker`, `jobs` and `receiver` compose services differ only by `command`. Workers scale independently via `deploy.replicas`.

| Service | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| api | 3000 | Express + Socket.io |
| dashboard | 8080 | nginx serving the built Vue app, proxies `/v1` and `/socket.io` to api |
| worker | – | no exposed port, N replicas |
| jobs | – | retention + stuck-delivery sweeper |
| receiver | 4000 | demo target that simulates 500 / slow / flaky responses |
| postgres | 5432 | |
| redis | 6379 | |
| rabbitmq | 5672 / 15672 | official image, no plugin required |

Node 24 LTS is the pinned runtime, declared identically in `engines`, `.nvmrc` and the Docker base image. Only `dashboard` (8080) and `api` (3000) publish ports to the host; `/metrics` is reachable on the Docker network only and is never exposed publicly.

### 2.1 Startup Order

`postgres`, `redis` and `rabbitmq` declare healthchecks. A one-shot `migrate` service runs `prisma migrate deploy` and exits; `api`, `worker` and `jobs` wait on `condition: service_completed_successfully` for it and `condition: service_healthy` for the infrastructure. No application process ever runs a migration itself, so concurrent workers cannot race on the schema.

Seeding is a separate opt-in command (`docker compose run --rm migrate npm run seed`) and is documented in the README as the demo path.

### 2.2 Demo Receiver

The bundled receiver exists so a fresh clone can watch the retry ladder without an external service. It logs every request with its headers and verifies the signature, then responds by route:

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `POST /ok` | `200` immediately |
| `POST /fail-500` | `500` always — drives a delivery to the DLQ |
| `POST /slow?ms=` | responds after the given delay, default 12000, exceeding `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| `POST /flaky?rate=` | fails with `503` at the given probability, default 0.5 |
| `GET /received` | the last 100 requests as JSON, for assertions in tests |

Seed data points the demo endpoint at `http://receiver:4000/flaky?rate=0.7`, so the first minutes of a fresh install show retries, successes and a permanent failure. The seed writes a fixed signing secret taken from `DEMO_ENDPOINT_SECRET`, and the receiver reads the same variable, which is how it can verify signatures without any wiring between the two processes. That variable is demo-only and is documented as such in `.env.example`.

### 2.3 Secrets and First Run

`JWT_SECRET` and `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` have no defaults. `.env.example` carries placeholder values that are explicitly invalid, alongside the command that generates real ones (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Startup refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production` and either value is still a placeholder, is shorter than 32 bytes, or is shared between the two. A public repository whose quickstart ships working default secrets is a public repository whose deployments all share one key.

`SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` cannot be rotated without re-encrypting every stored endpoint secret; that migration is out of scope for v1 and the constraint is stated in the README rather than discovered later.

## 3. End-to-End Data Flow

        |                       |      +-> RabbitMQ retry.<ttl> queue (TTL -> DLX -> main queue)
        +-> Socket.io event     |      +-> Postgres: RETRYING
                                |
                                +-> permanent || attempt >= MAX_ATTEMPTS:
                                       +-> RabbitMQ webhook.dlq
                                       +-> Postgres: FAILED_PERMANENTLY
                                       +-> Socket.io failure alert
```

### 3.1 Event Types and Fan-out

An `eventType` matches `^[a-z0-9]+([._-][a-z0-9]+)*$`, at most 64 characters — lowercase, dot-separated by convention (`order.created`, `invoice.paid`). It is validated at ingestion, so a typo cannot silently create a new event type that no endpoint subscribes to.

`Endpoint.eventTypes` selects what an endpoint receives:

* empty array — every event type of the project
* exact entries — `order.created` matches only that type
* one trailing wildcard segment — `order.*` matches `order.created` and `order.paid`, but not `order.line.added`; `*` alone is rejected, since an empty array already means that and two ways to say one thing invite mistakes

When `endpointIds` is supplied explicitly it overrides subscription matching, but never project scoping: an id belonging to another project is rejected with `422`, and the response never reveals whether that id exists.

Publishing an event that matches no endpoint returns `422` rather than a silent `202`. Sending data nowhere is almost always a configuration error, and the caller is the only party who can fix it.

## 4. Queue Topology (TTL + DLX chain, no plugins)

Delayed retries use per-level TTL queues that dead-letter back into the main queue. This requires no RabbitMQ plugin, so the official image works unmodified and a fresh clone needs no custom broker build.

| Object | Type | Config |
|---|---|---|
| `webhook.exchange` | direct exchange | main routing |
| `webhook.delivery` | queue | bound with key `delivery`; consumed by workers |
| `webhook.retry` | direct exchange | receives retry publishes |
| `webhook.retry.1m` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 60000`, DLX `webhook.exchange`, DLK `delivery`, no consumer |
| `webhook.retry.5m` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 300000`, same DLX |
| `webhook.retry.30m` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 1800000`, same DLX |
| `webhook.retry.2h` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 7200000`, same DLX |
| `webhook.retry.6h` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 21600000`, same DLX |
| `webhook.throttle.10s` | queue | `x-message-ttl: 10000`, same DLX — endpoint rate-limit parking, does not count as an attempt |
| `webhook.dlx` | direct exchange | terminal failures |
| `webhook.dlq` | queue | no TTL, no consumer; inspected and replayed from the dashboard |

Each retry level needs its own queue because RabbitMQ expires messages only from the head of a queue; mixing TTLs in one queue would block short delays behind long ones.

**Message body:** `{ deliveryId, attempt }` only. Payload and endpoint secret are read from Postgres by the worker, so the broker never stores secrets, messages stay small, and a manual replay is a plain re-publish.

Topology is declared idempotently at API and worker startup from one `shared/queue/topology.js` definition. Queue arguments are immutable in RabbitMQ: changing a TTL requires a new queue name or a manual delete, so topology changes are treated as migrations. `npm run queue:reset` performs that delete-and-redeclare in development, and refuses a queue that still holds messages unless it is forced.

**Routing keys.** `webhook.exchange` routes `delivery`, `webhook.retry` routes `retry.<level>` and `throttle.10s`, `webhook.dlx` routes `dlq`. Every object name is built from one namespace — `webhook` in every process — so an integration test can declare the same shape under its own namespace with millisecond TTLs instead of fighting the immutable arguments of the real queues.

**Publishing.** Publishes go through a confirm channel and are awaited, so the API answers `202` only once the broker has taken responsibility for the message. A channel is never created without an `error` listener: amqplib escalates an unhandled channel fault to the connection and closes it, which would turn one missing queue into a dead process.

## 5. Retry Strategy

Maximum **6 HTTP attempts**: 1 initial delivery plus 5 retries.

| Attempt | Delay before it | Queue |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | immediate | `webhook.delivery` |
| 2 | 1 minute | `webhook.retry.1m` |
| 3 | 5 minutes | `webhook.retry.5m` |
| 4 | 30 minutes | `webhook.retry.30m` |
| 5 | 2 hours | `webhook.retry.2h` |
| 6 | 6 hours | `webhook.retry.6h` |

After attempt 6 fails, the delivery is routed to `webhook.dlq`, marked `FAILED_PERMANENTLY`, and automated retries cease. Manual replay from the dashboard creates a new Delivery row referencing the same WebhookEvent, with a fresh attempt counter and `replayedFromId` set.

**Failure classification:**
* Retryable — connection errors, DNS failures, request timeout, `408`, `425`, `429`, all `5xx`.
* Permanent (no retry, immediate `FAILED_PERMANENTLY`) — `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `410`, `422`, and any `3xx`, since redirects are not followed and a redirecting endpoint is a configuration error.
* When the response carries `Retry-After` and its value exceeds the scheduled delay, the next larger retry level is used instead.

Any 4xx not named above is permanent as well: a request the receiver rejected does not become acceptable by being sent again.

Delays carry ±10% jitter, applied as a per-message `expiration` no greater than the queue TTL, so a recovering downstream host is not hit by a thundering herd. The cap makes the jitter one-sided in practice — the expiration can only shorten a delay, so the spread lands in the 10% below each level rather than around it.

`MAX_ATTEMPTS` is not free-form: the ladder has exactly one queue per retry level, so the value must equal `retry levels + 1`. Startup validates this against the schedule and refuses to run on a mismatch. Changing the schedule means changing the queue set, and queue arguments are immutable — see the migration note in §4. Lowering `MAX_ATTEMPTS` to stop earlier is the only change that needs no new queue.

## 6. Delivery Execution Rules

* Timeouts are split: 3000 ms connect, 10000 ms total (`DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`).
* Redirects are never followed (`redirect: manual`).
* The request body is the exact stored JSONB serialization, and the same bytes are signed.
* Response capture: status, duration, a whitelisted header subset, and the first 8 KB of the body.
* **SSRF guard (mandatory).** The target host is resolved before connecting and rejected when it maps to loopback, private (RFC1918), link-local (including `169.254.169.254`), CGNAT, multicast or reserved ranges. The resolved IP is pinned for the connection so DNS cannot be re-pointed between check and connect. `SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE` defaults to `false`; the compose demo sets `SSRF_ALLOWLIST_HOSTS=receiver` so only the bundled receiver is reachable inside the Docker network.
* Only `http` and `https` schemes are accepted; non-standard ports can be blocked via `SSRF_BLOCKED_PORTS`.
* The endpoint row is read at attempt time, not captured when the event was published. A URL or secret edited between attempts applies to the next retry, which is what makes fixing a wrong URL and waiting for the retry a valid recovery path. The event payload, by contrast, is immutable once ingested.
* **Acknowledgement:** the message is acked only after the HTTP attempt is finalized and the `DeliveryAttempt` row plus the `Delivery` status update are committed in one transaction. A worker crash before commit causes redelivery, so the system is **at-least-once** and receivers must deduplicate on `X-Webhook-Id`. Consumer `prefetch` is `WORKER_PREFETCH` (default 10).

## 7. Outbound Signature (HMAC SHA-256)

Headers on every outbound request:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Webhook-Id` | delivery id, the idempotency key for the receiver |
| `X-Webhook-Event` | event type |
| `X-Webhook-Attempt` | attempt number, 1-based |
| `X-Webhook-Timestamp` | unix seconds |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | `v1=<hex>`; comma-separated when a rotated secret is still valid |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `HookTracker/1.0` |

The signed string is `<timestamp>.<rawBody>`, where `rawBody` is the exact byte sequence sent. Receivers must reject a timestamp skew above 300 seconds and compare signatures with a constant-time function.

**Secret rotation:** `Endpoint.secret` and `Endpoint.previousSecret` can both be active. During the overlap both signatures are sent so a receiver migrates without downtime; the previous secret expires at `secretRotatedAt + SECRET_ROTATION_GRACE_HOURS`.

## 8. Idempotency & Deduplication

* Clients may send an `Idempotency-Key` header. When absent, the key defaults to `sha256(eventType + canonicalJson(payload))`.
* Redis key `idem:{projectId}:{sha256(key)}` stores the original 202 response body for `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS` (default 86400).
* A repeat within the window returns the original response with `Idempotency-Replayed: true` and creates no new deliveries.
* A concurrent duplicate (key reserved, response not yet stored) returns `409 Conflict`.

## 9. Rate Limiting

* **Ingestion:** sliding-window counter in Redis per API key, `RATE_LIMIT_PUBLISH_PER_MINUTE` (default 600). Exceeding it returns `429` with `Retry-After` plus `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining` and `RateLimit-Reset`.
* **Per-endpoint delivery:** token bucket in Redis keyed by endpoint, sized from `Endpoint.rateLimitPerMinute`. When the worker cannot take a token it publishes the message to `webhook.throttle.10s` and acks. This does not increment `attemptCount` and writes no `DeliveryAttempt` row.
* **Auth routes:** a stricter per-IP limit to slow credential stuffing.

## 10. Endpoint Health & Circuit Breaking

`Endpoint.consecutiveFailures` increments on each permanent failure and resets on any success. At `ENDPOINT_AUTO_DISABLE_THRESHOLD` (default 20) the endpoint moves to `DISABLED`, an `endpoint.disabled` event is emitted, and new publishes skip it — recorded as a `SKIPPED` delivery so the audit trail stays complete. Re-enabling is a manual dashboard action.

## 11. Data Model (Prisma / PostgreSQL)

```text

Membership      userId, projectId, role: OWNER | MEMBER        @@id([userId, projectId])

                replayedFromId, createdAt
                @@index([endpointId, createdAt(sort: Desc)])
                @@index([status, nextAttemptAt])
                @@index([eventId])  @@index([replayedFromId])

                @@index([deliveryId, attemptNumber])
```

Foreign keys that no list view filters on still carry an index, because a cascade delete and a restrict check both scan the child table.

`Endpoint.rateLimitPerMinute` defaults to 600 — high enough that a fresh endpoint is never throttled by surprise, low enough to stay a real ceiling.

API keys are stored hashed and the plaintext is shown exactly once at creation; `keyPrefix` (the first 8 characters after the `ht_` marker) is the lookup index. Endpoint secrets are encrypted at rest with `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-GCM).

Every dashboard query is scoped by a `projectId` derived from the membership set in the JWT, never from a client-supplied parameter.

`Membership` is the one table with no surrogate key: the pair it joins is already unique, and there is no id prefix for a row that is never addressed on its own.

**Client generation.** The Prisma v7 `prisma-client` generator writes TypeScript into `backend/src/generated/prisma`, which is git-ignored and regenerated during the image build. Node 24 runs it through type stripping, so no build step is added for a JavaScript codebase. v7 also requires a driver adapter — `@prisma/adapter-pg` over `pg`. Both details live in `shared/db.js`, the only module that imports the generated client.

**Identifiers.** Primary keys are `cuid2` values carrying a type prefix, generated in the application layer by a single `shared/ids.js` helper: `usr_`, `prj_`, `key_`, `ep_`, `evt_`, `dlv_`, `att_`. The prefix makes an id self-describing in logs, dashboards and support requests, and makes a wrong-entity lookup fail loudly instead of silently returning nothing.

**Time.** Every timestamp column is `timestamptz` and every value is stored in UTC. Conversion to a local zone happens in the dashboard only, and `from` / `to` filters are accepted as ISO-8601 with an explicit offset.

**Cascades.** `Membership`, `ApiKey`, `Endpoint` and `WebhookEvent` cascade from `Project`. `Delivery` cascades from `WebhookEvent`, and `DeliveryAttempt` from `Delivery`, which is what makes the retention job a single delete on `WebhookEvent`. `Delivery.endpointId` is `onDelete: Restrict`: deleting an endpoint with delivery history is refused, and the dashboard offers disable instead, so the audit trail cannot be erased by accident.

## 12. Authentication & Multi-Tenancy

* **Dashboard users:** email and password (argon2id). The access token is a 1-hour JWT returned in the response body; the refresh token is a 7-day opaque token in an `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookie, rotated on each use and revocable server-side.
* **Ingestion clients:** `Authorization: Bearer ht_<key>`. Lookup by prefix, verification by constant-time hash comparison, rejection when `revokedAt` is set.
* Authorization is membership-based. `OWNER` manages members, API keys and endpoint secrets; `MEMBER` has read access plus replay.

**Cookie flags.** The refresh cookie is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/v1/auth`, and `Secure` whenever `NODE_ENV=production`. `Secure` is off in local development because the compose stack serves plain HTTP on localhost and a `Secure` cookie would never be stored there — a first-run failure that reads as a broken login.

**CORS.** In the compose topology nginx serves the dashboard and proxies `/v1` and `/socket.io`, so browser requests are same-origin and no CORS headers are needed. For the Vite dev server, which runs on a different port, the API enables CORS only for the origins listed in `CORS_ORIGINS`, with `credentials: true` so the refresh cookie travels. The list is empty by default: a deployment that never sets it cannot be called from an arbitrary site.

## 13. Real-Time Layer (Socket.io)

* Namespace `/realtime`; the JWT is verified during the handshake, not after connect.
* A socket joins only the `project:{projectId}` rooms its membership covers, which is what prevents cross-tenant leakage.
* Events and their payloads:

```text
delivery.created    { deliveryId, eventId, endpointId, eventType, createdAt }
delivery.attempted  { deliveryId, attempt, responseStatus, durationMs, nextAttemptAt }
delivery.succeeded  { deliveryId, attempt, responseStatus, durationMs, completedAt }
delivery.failed     { deliveryId, attempt, reason: RETRYABLE | PERMANENT | EXHAUSTED,
                      errorCode, responseStatus, completedAt }
endpoint.disabled   { endpointId, consecutiveFailures, disabledAt }
```

  Payloads carry ids, never the webhook body or any secret; the dashboard fetches detail over the API when a row is opened.
* Workers hold no sockets. They publish to Redis pub/sub and API instances fan out through `@socket.io/redis-adapter`, which is also what makes multiple API replicas correct.
* Emissions are throttled per project (`REALTIME_MAX_EVENTS_PER_SECOND`) so a burst cannot drown the dashboard.
* A socket outlives the 1-hour access token that opened it. The server records each connection's token expiry and disconnects it with a `token_expired` reason at that moment; the client refreshes and reconnects. Sockets are not left authenticated indefinitely, and revoking a session takes effect within the access token's remaining life rather than never.

## 14. Observability

* `GET /health` for liveness with no dependency checks; `GET /ready` verifies Postgres, Redis and RabbitMQ reachability.
* `GET /metrics` in Prometheus format:

```text
hooktracker_publish_requests_total{result}
hooktracker_deliveries_total{status}
hooktracker_delivery_attempts_total{outcome,response_class}
hooktracker_delivery_duration_seconds        histogram
hooktracker_delivery_attempt_number          histogram
hooktracker_queue_depth{queue}               gauge
hooktracker_dlq_size                         gauge
hooktracker_endpoints_disabled_total
```

Labels are deliberately low-cardinality: no project id, endpoint id or URL appears in a label. Prometheus creates one time series per label combination, so a per-project label turns into unbounded series growth as tenants are added. Per-project figures come from the database through `GET /v1/projects/:projectId/stats`, which is what the dashboard uses.
* Structured JSON logs via `pino`, carrying `requestId` on the API and `deliveryId` with `attempt` on the worker. Secrets, API keys and `Authorization` headers are removed through a pino redaction path list rather than ad-hoc string handling.
* Graceful shutdown on `SIGTERM`: stop consuming, wait for in-flight attempts up to `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS`, close the channel, then the connection pool.

## 15. Retention & Maintenance Jobs

The `jobs` process runs two schedules:
* **Retention** — deletes `WebhookEvent` rows older than `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) in batches, cascading to deliveries and attempts.
* **Stuck sweeper** — deliveries left `IN_FLIGHT` longer than `STUCK_DELIVERY_MINUTES` are returned to `RETRYING` and re-published, covering a worker killed between HTTP completion and commit.

## 16. Configuration Reference

`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `RABBITMQ_URL`, `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `LOG_LEVEL`,
`JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_ACCESS_TTL`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS`, `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS` (empty by default),
`DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DELIVERY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `WORKER_PREFETCH`,
`MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` (default 262144), `RESPONSE_SNIPPET_BYTES`,
`RATE_LIMIT_PUBLISH_PER_MINUTE`, `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS`, `BULK_REPLAY_LIMIT` (default 500),
`SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE`, `SSRF_ALLOWLIST_HOSTS`, `SSRF_BLOCKED_PORTS`,
`ENDPOINT_AUTO_DISABLE_THRESHOLD`, `SECRET_ROTATION_GRACE_HOURS`,
`RETENTION_DAYS`, `STUCK_DELIVERY_MINUTES`, `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS`,
`REALTIME_MAX_EVENTS_PER_SECOND`.

`DEMO_ENDPOINT_SECRET` exists only for the bundled seed and receiver and is absent from a real deployment.

All values are validated by a zod schema at startup; the process exits on a missing or malformed value instead of starting degraded. Validation also covers the cross-field rules stated above: `MAX_ATTEMPTS` against the retry schedule, and the production secret checks from §2.3.

## 17. Out of Scope for v1

Endpoint filtering beyond `eventTypes`, payload transformation, mTLS to receivers, OAuth-signed deliveries, per-endpoint ordering guarantees, and sharding of the delivery tables. Ordering is explicitly not guaranteed, since retries reorder deliveries by design.
